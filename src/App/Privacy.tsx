      <h3>* Addendum:</h3>
      <p>
        While Caring Child Daycare strives to be as realistic as possible for the purposes of "selling"
        the daycare vibe, this is, at the end of the day, a demo website.

        While the forms that exist on here were crafted to be similar to a real daycare website, <b>PLEASE</b> do not actually
        send personally identifiable information. While it'll ultimately
        be deleted or sit in my spam box, it's not something I actually want. The forms are for realism.

        I don't know that it needs to be said, but this isn't a real daycare. Enjoy the copywriting for what it is,
        but don't treat it as more than it is.
      </p>

      <h3>** Addendum 2:</h3>
      <p>
        This is good practice for all websites, honestly. While it's boring, it's a good practice. Both as a safety 
        practice, but also because sometimes they're funny. Ever read Apple's TOS? 
        They have a bit about not using iTunes to operate nukes. It's probably more meant for apple products in general, 
        like Macbooks and stuff, but it's included in the iTunes one too.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...For that matter, if you actually read this one fully, you'd have also found this. 
        I don't expect many people to, but for those that did, hello! This entire thing is more for realism and 
        covering myself, but I also just enjoy having fun with the copywriting. It's not really a 
        thing in my main portfolio site, but the demo sites I build tend to do so. If you noticed the names, 
        and some other quirks you probably picked up on that. It makes this less tedious.
