      <h1>The Caring Child Difference</h1>
      <br />
      <h2>Exceptional Care That Matters</h2>

      <p>
        There are many things that make Caring Child Daycare different from other facilities.
        Between our personal standards of care, increased security, and high
        standards, there&apos;s a lot to bring to the table. There are unique perks that you as a parent
        will receive by joining the Caring Child Daycare family.
      </p>

      <h2>Communication</h2>

      <p>
        All of our centers at Caring Child Daycare provide feedback to parents. Whether this be
        weekly reports, or just general information for upcoming events, you will never be out of the loop with your child&apos;s overall progression.
      </p>

      <h2>Free Diapers, Wipes, and Formula</h2>

      <p>
        Button&apos;s Baby Needs products are supplied to any and all infants and young toddlers while
        at our centers as a value incentive &#40;and for peace of mind&#41; to parents. This is included
        in your tuition. We also provide the option to have formula supplied to
        your baby for feedings, free of charge.
      </p>

      <h2>Supper for Children in Need</h2>

      <p>
        At Caring Child, we understand times can are tough for many in the area. For working class
        parents, there&apos;s sometimes not enough hours in the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a part of our Financial Relief System, we offer parents the option to have their child provided
        supper during the times they are at our centers.
        While this is included as a standard for any child that stays past 4 pm &ndash; feel free to
        talk to a member of staff to have a packed meal provided for supper at
        home if needed. No child deserves to go hungry, and parents shouldn&apos;t have to worry about where
        their children&apos;s next meal is going to come from.
      </p>

        on us to be open during inclement weather&#42;. We do close for a few major holidays &#40;New Years Day,
        Memorial Day, 4th of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas&#41;, but we strive to be open as frequently as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        &#42;Our goal is to open all of our Centers on time, however, if weather conditions make it
        impossible for staff to safely arrive at the center, we&apos;ll be forced to open a bit later, close a
        bit early, or close for the day entirely. In cases where we have to
        change our schedule &#40;following Government issued warnings&#41;, we&apos;ll notify parents ahead of time.
        Please understand, this is for the safety of parents, their children, and our staff.
      </p>

      <h2>Summer Camp Fun</h2>

      <p>
        Caring Child offers a summer camp program for children in our centers. Activities include
        skill building, improvements in social interaction, and more! Camp Wannnahawk is here to
        provide education and fun through camp activities to keep your
        child learning even when school is not in session.
